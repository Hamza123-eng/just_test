Device is turned on

setup function {
  Device checks if the Wifi SSID has been changed

  if (changed - meaning that the device has been previous set up) {
    try saved SSIDs and Passwords

    if (connected) {
      indicator of successful connection (green light or something), could even be a message on the app at some point
      go into normal operation mode
    }
    else {
      indicator of unsuccessful connection
      go into wifi-less operation mode
    }
  }
  else (not changed - meaning that the device has never had a wifi network set up it) {
    BLE setup mode - maybe should have an indicator light signaling this.
    Wifi set up flow
    enter normal operation mode
  }
}



NORMAL OPERATION - loop function:

Will use FreeRTOS to allow simultaneous tasking

1. CheckIOT, listen for MQTT messages, download recordings, send success message - every 30 minutes or based on some input from user
2. PLay recording every time a button is pressed - also count number of times pressed and send in MQTT message in checkIot function
3. Go into deep sleep between downloads and button presses
4. Some specific input will allow it to go into BLE setup mode again
5. Listen for MQTT message for the 'Find My Linkie' feature - could potentially try to go through BLE 
  but this would require hardware that supports using bluetooth and wifi simultaneously and require bluetooth to always be on 
  maybe we should look into Bluetooth energy consumption... but seems like a poor trade off, depending on energy usage
